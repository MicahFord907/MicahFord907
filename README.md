## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer, and this repository showcases how I build end-to-end ML pipelines using scikit-learn and Pandas. My focus is on creating clean, modular workflows that take raw data through preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

A major part of my work involves data wranglingâ€”cleaning messy datasets, handling missing values, normalizing formats, and reshaping data into a usable structure. I use Pandas extensively for exploratory data analysis (EDA), merging data sources, and preparing features. I believe a well-prepared dataset is half the battle in any machine learning project.

Once the data is structured, I apply feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful patterns. This includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, generating interaction terms, and crafting domain-specific features when appropriate. I often use Pipeline and ColumnTransformer from scikit-learn to keep the transformation logic reusable and transparent.

For modeling, I use scikit-learnâ€™s consistent interface to train and compare different algorithmsâ€”such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting methods. I rely on cross-validation, grid search, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC to evaluate model performance in a structured way. Visualizations and reports help interpret results and guide iteration.

This repository reflects how I build practical machine learning solutions: structured, testable, and ready for real-world data. Each project includes code, sample data, and documentation to help others understand and replicate the work. Whether youâ€™re a beginner looking to learn the basics or a practitioner interested in pipeline design, I hope youâ€™ll find something useful here.
